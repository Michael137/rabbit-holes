# Observations
1. libstdc++/clang++: float >> int (and int is faster than with libc++/libc++)
2. libc++/clang++: float < int
3. libstdc++/g++: float < int
4. libc++/clang++ (float, int8) >>> libstdc++/g++ (float, int8)

# Questions
(4): why is libstdc++ so much better at sampling from int?
(2-3): why is sampling from a float distribution faster than int?
(1): why the inverted profile?

# TODO
1. Plot distributions
2. Write comparison snippets
3. Assembly
4. Profile
